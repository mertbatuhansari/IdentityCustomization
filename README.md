# IdentityCustomization
I'm creating an ASP.NET Core Web App MVC project with the .NET 8.0 Framework. In this project, I've customized the IdentityUser and IdentityRole classes using the 'Entity Framework Core Identity' package. I've configured database settings with a Configuration class and managed my application's middleware settings.
